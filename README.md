Fire Emblem Archive Tool (A tool to automatically extract data from 3DS Fire Emblem archives)

### Usage:
Drag and Drop files to decompress of extract them<br />
Drag and Drop a **file** while holding CTRL to compress it to lz13<br />
Drag and Drop a **folder** while holding CTRL to turn it into an ARC<br />
**Auto Extract** option will automatically extract files, when possible, after decompression.<br />
**Build Textures** enables BCH texture importing and CTPK rebuilding.<br />
Drag and Drop and folder with a bch in the same directory to import replace the files in the bch with the matching ones in the folder.<br />
Drag and Drop an Extract CTPK folder to rebuild the CTPK.<br />
**Arc Padding** adds the padding for arc files used by Fates.<br />
**Arc File Alignment** adjust the byte alignment for files inside the arc. Fates uses 128 while Awakening usually uses 0<br />
